# Task Queue Notes

`QUEUE.md` is the canonical backlog for small deterministic implementation passes.

Use this queue when:
- a cron run should execute one bounded task
- changes need a clear done condition
- work must be reviewable and easy to hand off

Do not place broad strategy efforts here; split them into small tasks first.
